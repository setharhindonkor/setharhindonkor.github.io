									<p> The datasets are from Pharmaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. 
										In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of 
										skin cancer.  In this study, 250 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 
										45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals Inc.'s 
										drug of interest, Capomulin, versus nine (9) other treatment regimens. A summary of action items executed are as follows: 
									<ul> 
										<li><b>Merge multiple datasets and clean the data.</b></li>
										<li><b>Exploratory data analysis of variables (histograms, bar plots, pie charts, boxplots, scatter plots).</b></li>
										<li><b>Summary statistics .</b></li>
										<li><b>Correlation and regression.</b></li>
									</ul>

									<p>The cost of hospital readmission accounts for a large portion of hospital inpatient services spending. Diabetes is not only one of the top 
										ten leading causes of death in the world, but also the most expensive chronic disease in the United State. Hospitalized patients with diabetes 
										are at higher risk of readmission than those without diabetes. Therefore, reducing readmission rates for diabetic patients has a great potential 
										to reduce medical cost significantly. The objective of this study is to predict the likelihood of a diabetic patient being readmitted. The original 
										dataset was obtained from the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at University of California, Irvine. It was collected from 
										130 hospitals in the U.S. during a period of 10 years. A summary of action items executed in Python are as follows: 
										<ul> 
											<li><b>Extensive exploration of the dataset.</b></li>
											<li><b>Build a couple of machine learning models.</b></li>
											<li><b>Model assessment (using precision, recall, F1 score, AUC and accuracy measures how do the models compare with one another.) </b></li>
											<li><b>Assess the loophole in the accuracy measure.</b></li>
											<li><b>Correct for imbalance in the data using the concept of undersampling.</b></li>

									<p> A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, 
										is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. They need a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and 
										to determine whether they can be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.A raw data has been obtained to be 
										processed and fit to the machine learning models. Since there is no known classification system, this will require unsupervised learning. 
										Several clustering algorithms will be used to explore whether the cryptocurrencies can be grouped together with other similar cryptocurrencies. Data visualization will be used to share findings with the investment bank.
